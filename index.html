                    Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good
                    headline for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to
                    just skip that?

                    This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We
                    were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any
                    headlines, titles or subject lines.

                    We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some
                    headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!

            <div> 
            <p>Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.</p>
            <div class="space"></div>
            <p>They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share our collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.</p>
